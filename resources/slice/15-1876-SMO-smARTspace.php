          <h4>Two New Art Exhibitions</h4>

          <p><strong>February 25, 2016</strong></p>

          <p>Explore the intersection of art and science with two inaugural exhibits: "Hidden Spaces: The Artwork of
            <br/> Jason Cytaki and Haley Prestifilippo," and "MAGNIFIcence: The Microcosmic Perspective."</p>

          <p><strong>MAGNIFIcence</strong><br/>
            Explores the tiny details of the world in larger-than-life fashion. The exhibition features macro
            photography â€“ enlarged photos of small objects, including photographs using scanning electron microscopes
            (SEM). The exhibit displays the work of five artists and scientists. The work of Thomas Shahan, whose work
            has appeared in National Geographic, features stunning macro portraits of spiders. Photographer Christian
            Bruggeman details the surface of the human iris.</p>

          <p>Visitors can compare actual insect specimens with the larger than life photo-stacked prints by artist Bob
            Sober, and guess what is revealed in the SEM photography in the "Eye of Science " a collaboration by Oliver
            Meckes and Nicole Ottawa.</p>

            <strong>Hidden Spaces</strong><br/>
            An exhibit of artwork in various media created by Jason Cytaki and Haley Prestifilippo. Both artists play on
            the theme of hidden spaces, but in very different contexts. Cytaki's large-scale oil paintings and dioramas
            call to mind the secret lairs and hidden places often found in childhood stories of adventure. In these
            works, laboratories, bizarre machines and winding paths characterize fantastical avenues of exploration.
            Prestifilippo's small, surreal graphite drawings on paper depict a menagerie of animals bound together by
            natural forces such as rock, vegetation and clouds.

          <p>Hidden Spaces invites the viewer to create a story by asking questions about what is happening now, what
            happened before and what might occur in the future," Henderson said. "The process of telling stories is a
            way for people to explore the world and it leads to innovation and problem solving. Innovations in science,
            technology, mathematics, philosophy, and more have all have benefited from these leaps of the
            imagination"</p>
