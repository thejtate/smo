            <h3>What is Science Matters Mobile Museum?</h3>

            <p>Science Matters is a fully immersive exhibition contained within
              a 40-foot truck that literally pulls into your parking lot.  
              Students climb on-board and are transported into an interactive
              environment with highly engaging exhibits that encourage them to
              explore, investigate and experiment.

            <h6>How many will it serve?</h6>

            <div class="item">

              <p>The Science Matters visit is customized to ensure students
                nurture their own sense of curiosity, a necessary and
                vital element of any budding scientist.  This could be
                anywhere from a few hours to a full day.  The optimum number
                of students per session is 25 and it takes approximately 45 minutes
                to complete the exhibits.

            <h6>Cost Involved</h6>

            <div class="item">
