          <blockquote>
            <p>The SMO is a fantastic venue to host an event! The Infant Crisis Services Young Professionals Board
              thoroughly enjoyed working with the SMO staff to plan, implement and host Bingo for Babies in such a
              unique space. Our decision to have our event at the SMO came down to cost, plenty of space and parking
              available, and a fun environment in a central location. The SMO perfectly met all of our criteria and were
              extremely accommodating. We look forward to hosting future events at the SMO.”</p>

            <p>My SMO experience was excellent from the start. The Events staff was knowledgeable, kind and quick to
              respond. Abigail was prompt to schedule a walk through and confirm our conference room was exactly what we
              were looking for. I was greeted on time at the main entrance during every visit adding a very personal
              touch to my experience. If you are looking for a centrally located conference center with a friendly staff
              and unique backdrop then SMO is the place for you!”</p>

            <p>SMO was the perfect place to host our leadership training program! The space was fantastic, staff was
              really easy to work with and my students were able to enjoy the museum after we wrapped up. It was the
              perfect blend of fun, practical and convenient. My students have already requested to go back next
              year.”</p>
